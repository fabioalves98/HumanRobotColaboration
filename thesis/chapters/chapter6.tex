\chapter{Experiments and Results}

\section{Collaborative Setup}

\par explain the real setup, robot, desk, camera

\section{Execution of the collaborative tasks}

\par - interaction, make a test to the double tap scenario, obtain results, present results... explain that the robot is ocnstatl giving feedback

\par  - hand guiding, falar da accuracy que ja foi explicada, but there is not much quantitative data to be shown

\par - object transfer, never fails

\par - object lifting assistance, fails, explain how it fails, make 20 tests or more where i give a object to the robot and it fails to calibrate correclty cuz sensor sucks... explian that by rasing hte force threshlod it solves the issue

\par - collision free execution, fails a lot, explain the situations where it fails and why

\section{System Stability}

\par explain that the robot is always stoping and complaining because payload is not set... explain that payload cannot be set... explain how to solve this issue such has the use of an external sensor
